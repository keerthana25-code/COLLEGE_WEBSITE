                <h2>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</h2>
               
                <p>
                    The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private land-grant research university in 
                    Cambridge, Massachusetts. Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the
                     development of many areas of modern technology and science.Founded in response to the 
                     increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic 
                     university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. 
                     MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being 
                     Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends 
                     more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major
                      off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack
                       Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1859, a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands
                     in Back Bay, Boston for a "Conservatory of Art and Science", but the proposal failed.
                      A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by 
                      William Barton Rogers, was signed by John Albion Andrew, the governor of Massachusetts, on
                       April 10, 1861.Rogers, a graduate of William and Mary and professor at UVA, wanted to 
                       establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances. He did 
                       not wish to found a professional school, but a combination with elements of both professional
                        and liberal education, proposing that:The true and only practicable object of a
                         polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and
                          manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of
                           those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with 
                           this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in 
                           connection with physical laws.
